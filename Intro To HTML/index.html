<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- declaration to let the browser know what type of document/file to expect. Back in the old days there were 3 types of html files, but in HTML5 there's only 1. Nowadays it's mainly for historical reasons. If it's left out, it may cause the browser to render the document as a different form of HTML, opening security and rendering issues, and possibly disallowing use of HTML5 tags -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- alerts browser that the entire page is in English; you can also declare other languages in tags -->
  <head> <!-- head contains additional info about the document; i.e., metadata for SEO, the title of the document, stylesheets, etc -->
    <title>A social media site</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- tells the browser which character set to use -->
  </head>
  <body> <!-- The visible (aka output) section of the page -->
    
    <!-- SEMANTICS -->
    <!-- We'll talk about semantics, which is the practice of writing markup to give components meaning. This exposes the browser's native accessibility tree to assistive technology and ensures that technology and browsers parse the HTML document as intended. It also means that a dev who is looking through to document can tell more quickly at a glance what each component is meant to do. Divs can be used for styling, but your core components should try to follow semantic markup -->
    
    <!-- DOM TREE -->
    <!-- DOM = Document Object Model. The DOM Tree describes the hierarchy of nodes (HTML tags) that live in the HTML document. It starts with the top level <html> tag, with <body> and <head> as children of <html> (and siblings of each other). Further "descendents" of body include: 
    
    <h1>, <p>, <ul> and so on.

    The DOM tree helps us understand the document's structure and each component's relation to other components on the page, and is particularly useful to us when we begin to understand CSS (in terms of inheritance) as well as JS (in terms of selecting the correct node in the DOM)
